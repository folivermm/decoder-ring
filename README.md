## About the Project

The Decoder Ring project is designed to provide an interactive tool for encoding and decoding messages using various ciphers. The application includes the following ciphers:

- **Caesar Shift**: A substitution cipher that shifts letters in the alphabet by a specified amount.
- **Polybius Square**: A cipher that represents each letter using coordinates in a grid.
- **Substitution Cipher**: A cipher that replaces letters with corresponding letters from a substitution alphabet.

These ciphers can be used to encode messages for fun, educational, or creative purposes.

## Using Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Throughout the development of this project, a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach was adopted. This involves the following steps:

1. **Writing Unit Tests**: Test cases were created using Mocha and Chai to ensure that the ciphers and algorithms function as expected.

2. **Expect Methods**: Various `expect()` methods were used to validate the behavior and output of the code.

3. **Running Tests**: Tests were executed from the command line to ensure that the implemented ciphers and algorithms pass the predefined test cases.

4. **Debugging and Iteration**: Debugging was performed by analyzing error messages and using the VSCode debugger. Iteration on code was done to improve the quality and correctness of the implementations.

## Achievements and Highlights

- Created a series of comprehensive unit tests using Mocha and Chai to validate the correctness of the implemented ciphers.
- Utilized various `expect()` methods to thoroughly test different aspects of the codebase.
- Successfully executed tests from the command line to validate the behavior of the ciphers and algorithms.
- Demonstrated the ability to iterate through strings, objects, and arrays to implement complex algorithms.
- Proficiently debugged code using error messages and the VSCode debugger, improving the overall quality of the implementations.
